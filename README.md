# Database Design
# 1. Users üßë
    This entity represents individuals using the platform, including both guests (renters) and hosts (property owners).
# 2. Properties üè†
    This entity represents the accommodations that hosts list on the platform.
# 3. Bookings üìÖ
    This entity tracks specific reservation requests and confirmed stays.
# 4. Reviews ‚≠ê
    This entity stores feedback and ratings left by guests about properties or hosts.
# 5. Payments üí≥
    This entity records all financial transactions related to bookings.

# Entity Relationships
The entities are related through Foreign Keys (FK), which link a field in one table to the Primary Key (PK) of another table.
# 1.	Users and Properties (One-to-Many):
o	A User can be a Host and list multiple Properties.
o	Each Property is owned by one User (Host).
o	Link: The Host ID (FK) in the Properties table references the User ID (PK) in the Users table.
# 2.	Users and Bookings (One-to-Many):
o	A User can be a Guest and make multiple Bookings.
o	Each Booking is made by one User (Guest).
o	Link: The Guest ID (FK) in the Bookings table references the User ID (PK) in the Users table.
# 3.	Properties and Bookings (One-to-Many):
o	A Property can have multiple Bookings.
o	Each Booking belongs to one Property.
o	Link: The Property ID (FK) in the Bookings table references the Property ID (PK) in the Properties table.
# 4.	Bookings and Reviews (One-to-One or One-to-Many):
o	A single Booking typically results in one Review (from the guest).
o	Each Review is linked to one Booking.
o	Link: The Booking ID (FK) in the Reviews table references the Booking ID (PK) in the Bookings table.
# 5.	Bookings and Payments (One-to-Many):
o	A single Booking may be associated with multiple Payments (e.g., initial deposit, final payment, or a refund).
o	Each Payment is associated with one Booking.
o	Link: The Booking ID (FK) in the Payments table references the Booking ID (PK) in the Bookings table.


# Team Roles
    Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
    Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
    DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
    QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# üìà API Documentation Overview
    REST API: Detailed documentation available through the OpenAPI standard, including endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments.
    GraphQL API: Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data.
# API Security
# 1. Authentication (Verifying Identity)
   Password Hashing & Salting	Protecting User Data: Passwords are never stored in plain text.
# 2. Authorization (Defining Permissions)
   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)	Preventing Unauthorized Access to Resources: Defines distinct roles like Guest, Host, and Admin. The system checks the user's role before allowing them to perform an action.
# 3. Rate Limiting (Preventing Abuse)
   Login Endpoint Throttling	Protecting Against Brute-Force Attacks: Limits the number of failed login attempts from a single IP address or user account within a specific time frame (e.g., 5 attempts per minute).
# Why Security is Crucial for Key Areas
   Project Area	Crucial Security Need
# User Data (PII)	Legal & Trust: 
   User data includes full names, emails, phone numbers, and possibly government IDs for verification. Breaching this data leads to severe GDPR/CCPA penalties, massive reputational damage, and identity theft risks for users. Strong authentication and encryption are essential.
# Securing Payments	Financial & Compliance:
   The system handles sensitive financial data (credit card tokens, bank account details). Security is crucial to prevent fraud and financial loss for both users and the platform. Compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is mandatory if card data is handled, making tokenization and secure payment gateways necessary.
# Booking/Listing Integrity	Trust & Business Operations: 
   If a malicious user could tamper with a booking (e.g., change the date, modify the price, or cancel it) or a property listing (e.g., change the address or Host ID), the core business model is destroyed. Authorization and Resource-Based Access Control prevent this form of manipulation.
# Platform Availability	Revenue Protection: 
   If the system is taken down by a DDoS attack, the company loses all booking revenue, and its reputation is ruined. Rate Limiting is the primary defense here, ensuring continuous service and a reliable user experience.

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD).
CI/CD pipelines are an automated set of practices and tools that streamline the software development lifecycle, from writing code to deploying it to users.
CI/CD is critical for a large-scale, user-facing platform like Airbnb for the following reasons:
# Speed and Frequency	
Allows for faster iteration and feature delivery. New features (like a property filter or a payment method) can be deployed in hours, not weeks, giving the platform a competitive edge.
# Quality and Reliability	
Automated testing catches bugs and security vulnerabilities (e.g., failed database migrations or broken API endpoints) before they reach production, leading to a more stable experience for users and hosts.
